# Best 6 Message Queues Most Suitable for Cloud Native Applications



## What is Message Queue

Message Queue is a common communication pattern used in software architecture to enable asynchronous communication between different components of a system. It allows one component of a system to send a message or task to another component, which may be running on a different server or in a different process or thread.

The message queue acts as a buffer between the sender and the receiver, holding messages until the receiver is ready to process them. This allows the sender to continue its work without having to wait for the receiver to process the message immediately. When the receiver is ready, it can pull messages from the queue and process them.

##  4 of the most well-known open source message queues

If you want to deeply understand a piece of software, you may want to pay attention to their birth background. To understand a person's character, one needs to know his family, because the family determines a person's genes. Similarly, if you want to understand a message queue, you may want to pay attention to the background of its birth, because the background will determine the DNA of a message queue.

If you take the time to sort out the history of message queues, you will find a very interesting phenomenon. Most of the currently popular message queues were born around 2010. For example, Apache Kafka was born at LinkedIn in 2010, Nats was developed by Derek Collison in 2010, and Apache Pulsar was born at Yahoo in 2012. What is the reason for this?

There are roughly three applications that make 2010 the era of the birth of message queues:

* Development of internet technology：Around 2010, thanks to the rapid development of the mobile Internet, users of Internet applications experienced an explosive growth. In 2008 Facebook had only 50 million users, and in 2010 it had 545 million users. Also in 2008, LinkedIn had 23 million users, compared to 161 million in 2011. With the rapid increase in the number of users, people increasingly need to process a large amount of real-time data streams, which greatly promotes the rapid development of Internet technology. As these demands cannot be met by traditional means of data transmission, storage and processing, there is a need for new solutions. Message queuing technology has also been greatly developed in this context.

* Popularity of distributed systems: Distributed systems became more and more popular around 2010, and distributed systems need an efficient, scalable, and reliable way to deliver messages. Message middleware was born to meet these needs.

* The Rise of Open Source Software：Around 2010, open source software started to become more and more popular. Open source software allows developers to use, modify and distribute the code freely, so many developers start to build their own solutions and share these solutions with other developers. Kafka, Pulsar, and NATS are all open source software, so they can be widely used and improved easily.

* The Rise of Cloud Computing: Around 2010, cloud computing started to become more and more popular. Cloud computing needs an efficient, scalable and reliable message delivery mechanism, which also promotes the development of message middleware.

The following is an introduction to the currently well-known open source message queues：

### 1 Apache Kafka

[Apache Kafka](#https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed streaming platform that is designed to handle high volumes of data in real-time. It was originally developed by LinkedIn in 2010 and later became an open-source project under the Apache Software Foundation in 2011.

Kafka is a publish-subscribe messaging system that enables applications to send and receive large amounts of data in real-time, using a message broker architecture. It provides a fast, scalable, and fault-tolerant way to process and store streams of data.

Kafka is commonly used for a variety of use cases such as:

- Real-time data processing: Kafka can be used to process and analyze large volumes of data in real-time, making it useful for use cases such as fraud detection, stock trading, and online advertising.
- Log aggregation: Kafka can collect logs from various sources and store them in a central location, making it easier to manage and analyze logs.
- Event streaming: Kafka can be used to stream events such as clicks, searches, and user interactions to various applications for real-time processing.

There is no doubt that Kafka is the most influential message queue today. In fact, it has become the de facto standard for big data transmission, and 80% of the Fortune 100 are using Kafka。Kafka is often used in combination with other tools in the big data ecosystem such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Apache Storm for data processing and analysis.

### 2 RabbitMQ

[RabbitMQ](#https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is an open source message broker software that allows applications to communicate with each other using a messaging protocol. It was developed by Rabbit Technologies and first released in 2007, which was later acquired by VMware.RabbitMQ is based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and provides a reliable, scalable, and interoperable messaging system.

With RabbitMQ, applications can send and receive messages from other applications or services. It can handle various types of messages, including text, binary data, and JSON, and provides features such as message queuing, routing, and persistence. RabbitMQ also supports multiple messaging protocols and has a range of plugins that extend its functionality.

RabbitMQ is one of the most popular Message Queue today. It is widely used in enterprise applications, cloud-based systems, and distributed systems, where different components need to communicate with each other asynchronously. It provides a reliable and efficient way to pass messages between applications and services, making it a popular choice for many organizations.

### 3 Nats

[NATS](#https://nats.io/) is an open-source, high-performance messaging system for distributed systems, cloud-native applications, and microservices architectures.It was initially developed by Derek Collison in 2010.  Derek Collison started developing NATS while working as the CTO of  Apcera, a cloud computing company.

NATS provides a lightweight and efficient messaging protocol for communication between different applications and services. It has a client-server architecture and supports various messaging patterns, including point-to-point, request-reply, and publish-subscribe.

NATS is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a small footprint and low latency. It is often used in cloud-native environments to connect different components of a distributed system or to enable communication between microservices. NATS also has support for message persistence, security, and clustering, making it a robust messaging system for building scalable and resilient applications.

### 4 Apache Pulsar

[Apache Pulsar](#https://pulsar.apache.org/) is an open-source distributed pub-sub messaging system that was originally developed by Yahoo.It was born in 2012, and its original purpose was to replace other message systems within Yahoo and build a message platform with a unified logical large cluster. 

Pulsar supports multiple messaging patterns, including publish-subscribe and message queuing, and provides a rich set of features, including:

- Multi-tenancy: Pulsar allows multiple applications to share a single cluster, with each application isolated from others.
- Geo-replication: Pulsar can replicate data across multiple clusters in different geographic regions, providing high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
- Message TTL: Pulsar allows messages to be automatically expired after a certain amount of time, which can be useful for implementing time-based workflows or cleaning up old data.
- Tiered storage: Pulsar can store messages in multiple tiers of storage, ranging from high-performance storage to cold storage, which can help reduce costs and improve performance.

Pulsar also provides a rich set of client libraries for a variety of programming languages, making it easy to build messaging and streaming applications using Pulsar. Apache Pulsar is a popular choice for real-time data processing and messaging in large-scale data processing applications, such as those used in the financial, telecommunications, and internet-of-things industries.



## 2 latest popular message queues

Like 2010, 2020 is also a very important year. Let's take a look at some background information around 2020:

* Global recession：Although we don't want to see it, we have to admit that the global economy is now in a massive recession. The spread of the epidemic around the world is one of the most important reasons. The recession has made business extremely difficult. Saving costs has become an important topic for many business executives.

* Enterprise cloud has become a global trend

* Kubernetes becomes the new infrastructure

* Serverless is becoming popular

If 2010 was the era of big data, then the application of 2020 is the era of cloud native. The new era has new requirements for message middleware. It is also for this reason that there will be a new message queue around 2020.

### 1 Redpanda

Redpanda is an open source distributed streaming platform that can be used as a high-performance message queue. Redpanda message queue is based on Apache Kafka's design but provides several improvements such as faster performance, lower latency, and better scalability.

Redpanda message queue allows multiple producers to write messages to a single topic, and multiple consumers to read messages from that topic in parallel. Messages can be buffered in memory for fast delivery and can be persisted to disk for durability. Redpanda also provides a number of features such as replication, partitioning, and compression to help manage large amounts of data.

One of the key benefits of using Redpanda message queue is its ability to handle large volumes of data in real-time. This makes it a popular choice for applications that require high throughput and low latency, such as streaming analytics, real-time monitoring, and online gaming.

Overall, Redpanda message queue is a powerful and flexible tool for building real-time streaming applications that require reliable and high-performance message processing.
