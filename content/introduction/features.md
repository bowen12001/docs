Vanus has a vast amount of features to help users achieve their goals. Let us share with you some of the key features Vanus has to offer.

**Entirely elastic:**

* No need to manually scale up or down the cluster.

* Expand new clusters in seconds after traffic increases.

* After the traffic is reduced, the cluster is reduced in seconds.

* Both storage and compute clusters can be scaled up and down.

**Lightweight & K8s native:**

* One-click deployment, 10s to complete the installation.
